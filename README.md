## Introduction

`singlecell_analyzer.ipynb` is a general purpose notebook for clustering of 10X single-cell RNA-seq data as well as differential expression analysis. The notebook uses the `scanpy` API.

The conda environment I use for data science and single-cell analysis is in `environment.yaml` for reference. This environment has all the tools you need to run the notebook.

`conda env create -f environment.yaml`
`conda activate datascience`
`jupyter lab`
